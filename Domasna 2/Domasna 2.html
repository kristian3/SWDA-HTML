        <p>Full body touch introduced <a href="httos://google.com">last year</a> has been further enhanced. How the ball is controlled depends more on the surrounding situation, allowing for smoother and contexual trapping of the ball.</p>

        <h3>Development</h3>
        <hr/>
        <p>Other features include a number of graphical boosts and 4K HDR support across all capable platforms.[11] Enlighten software has been used to rework lighting, both natural and stadium based.[12] Stands and pitches will closely mirror their real life counterparts depending on the time of day.</p>

        <h4>Kit unveiling</h4>
        <p>For the first time in history, a Pro Evolution Soccer game was used in a kit unveiling. <a href="httos://google.com">Liverpool</a> unveiled their new 3rd kit for the 2018–2019 football season by using in-game footage from PES 2019 via a post on social media. Liverpool claim they are the "first club to use video game graphics to launch a new jersey.</p>

        <h4>UEFA licence</h4>
        <p>The Konami-<a href="httos://google.com">UEFA</a> partnership was ended after ten years. The announcement was made in a press release posted on the UEFA website stating that "the <a href="httos://google.com">2018 UEFA Champions League Final in Kyiv</a> would mark the end of a very successful and fruitful 10-year partnership between Konami and the <a href="httos://google.com">UEFA Champions League</a>."</p>
        <p>Marketing director of UEFA Events SA Guy-Laurent Epstein said: "Konami has been a strong licensing partner for the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League, with our competition brand being heavily featured within the video game and as part of the popular Konami-organised UEFA Champions League e-sports tournaments’. UEFA would like to thank Konami for its tremendous commitment and support to UEFA club competitions for the last decade and we look forward to continuing to work with Konami in the sphere of UEFA national team football." While senior director of brand & business development for Konami Digital Entertainment B.V. Jonas Lygaard said "The UEFA Champions League licence has given us a platform to create unique experiences and provide football fans from all over the world with an opportunity to enjoy this competition first-hand. "This year, however, we will shift our focus into other areas. We will continue to explore alternative ways UEFA and Konami can continue to work together, as our relationship remains strong."</p>

        <h3>Club parterships</h3>
        <hr/>
        <p>Konami have signed a number of partnerships with clubs to faithfully re-create the clubs including kits; fully scanned players and stadiums.</p>

But this agreement was prematurely terminated by Borussia Dortmund".</p>

        <h4>FC Shalke 04</h4>
        <p>On June 4, 2018 Konami announced a new partnership with <a href="httos://google.com">FC Schalke 04</a> just days after Dortmund terminated their agreement,[24] as part of their establishment with S04 as a PES partner club, Konami produced a highly detailed recreation of the club's VELTINS arena with the use of state-of-the art 3D scanning technology with extremely high fidelity, detailed kits, player likenesses,[25] and a real-world shirt and ground sponsorship Konami states.[26] Alexander Jobst, Schalke's marketing director stated how Schalke was happy to have on board a world-famous games manufacturer like KONAMI.
